## Guidelines

The first step is to register yourself on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) using your Github account and sign up as a student.

Find the open source repositories which interest and go try to pick up issues which you can solve.If you don't find one and think you can improve the codebase create a issue stating the problem you want to solve using the proper guidelines. Once the issue is assigned to you, code away till you resolve the issue :nerd_face: . Once you are done with the coding create a pull request by following the proper **CONTRIBUTING.md** file given in the repository. If the repository doesn't have one, make a pull request following the accepted rules in the open source community :hugs:

You have to make 4 pull requests on any valid repositories. Once you make the pull request, there is a review period of two weeks. **PLEASE MAKE QUALITY PULL REQUESTS AND NOT SPAM** :rage:  If you make spam pull requests your pull request will be deemed invalid/spam and you will be unelligible to win swag
